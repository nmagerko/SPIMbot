CS 233 final project

#### Considerations

The `.gitignore` has both the `teamname` and `partners` text files ignored. This is because the `teamname` file is used by the course staff to determine which svn repository has the code for each team; if there are multiple repositories with this file non-empty and sharing the same name, it will choose randomly. Additionally, the `partners` file should only be filled out by in the svn repository that actually has the working code.

As such, be sure to fill out both of these files before the deadline in the proper repository.
